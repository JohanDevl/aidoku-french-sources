## 🏗️ Implementation Guidelines

### Before Starting a Source

1. **Research the site architecture**:
   - Check if it uses a known template (Madara, MangaStream, MMRCMS)
   - Analyze the HTML structure and API endpoints
   - Test the site availability and stability

2. **Update this roadmap**:
   - Move the source from "Upcoming" to "Work in Progress"
   - Add your name and start date
   - Include any specific technical notes

3. **Check existing implementations**:
   - Look for similar sites already implemented
   - Reuse templates when possible

### Implementation Process

1. **Site Analysis** - Understand the site structure
2. **Template Selection** - Choose appropriate template or custom implementation
3. **Configuration** - Create site-specific configuration files
4. **Testing** - Verify functionality with real data
5. **Documentation** - Update README and this roadmap
6. **Package Build** - Generate .aix package and test

### After Implementation

1. **Update README.md** - Add the new source to the main list
2. **Update this roadmap** - Remove from upcoming, update counters
3. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure the source works correctly
4. **Update CLAUDE.md** - Document any new patterns or learnings

## 📝 Notes

- Sources marked as "Unknown" type need investigation to determine their framework
- Priority levels are suggestions based on popularity and community requests
- Some sources might be offline or have changed URLs since the original reference list
- Adult content sources are marked separately and have lower priority
